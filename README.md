# Hello!
I'm ajh. I've worked on unblocked sites for years now, always innovating, striving for student privacy, and working with other people in the community to create better solutions. I have been interested in web development since I was 6 years old, built my first website at 8, and began coding at 12.

I am mainly known for AJH's Vault, a repository & website which is now under Talc Network, a brand I founded which holds other sites of mine.
