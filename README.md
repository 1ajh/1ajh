# About me

Hey! I'm Aidan -- 14 and a maker of things with a keen eye for detail. I am a full-stack web developer, music producer, and game site owner. I have been interested in web development since I was 6 years old, built my first website at 8, and started coding at 12.
Online, I am mainly known for [AJH's Vault](https://ajhmath.org), a renowned, open-source unblocked game site with over 120 titles. I've been working on these sorts of sites for three years now, always innovating, striving for student privacy, and working with other people in the community to create better solutions.
